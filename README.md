## Requirement: The WeChat Moments(Android)
======
####Overview
The assignment is to build an Android App which looks like WeChat Moments page. Production and Technical requirements are weighing equally in final result.
Production requirements

The view consists of profile image, avatar and tweets list
For each tweet, there will be a sender, optional content, optional images and comments, ignore the tweet which does not contain a content and images

A tweet contains from 0 to 9 images, make sure the layout is aligning
Load all tweets in memory at first time, and get 5 of them each time from memory asynchronously
Show 5 more while user pulling up the view at the bottom of view
Pulling down the view to refresh, only first 5 items are shown after refreshing
The layout in different Android devices(except tablet) should be considered

This is a static page, no more actions(tapping, pulling, multi-touching) are required. Any extra interaction is welcome and will be serious considered in a positive way. For any other unclear layout concerns, please reference current WeChat implementation.
Technical requirements

Utilise Git for source control
